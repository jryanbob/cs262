# OPUS
## Vision Statement

For Earth Mission Asia (EMA), a medical organization that works in the jungles of Myanmar, 
OPUS (Offline Patient Uploading Software) shall record medical information input by EMA’s
medical staff on their phones for ease of collective access. Unlike Patientware, the software 
currently in use which can only be used when connected to the internet, our product shall allow 
for offline input and storage of medical data which can then be uploaded to a server and 
updated locally once an internet connection is reached.  This added functionality is needed to 
allow the management of patient medical data when wifi and cellular reception are not available, 
a necessity for EMA as they send their medical staff deeper into the Myanmar jungles.
